{"name":"Raspberry Pi","tagline":"","body":"The Raspberry Pi is a compact computer that can be used for many, many cool things such as your own personal network storage device, a personal music player, a retro video game player, etc. Setting up the raspberry pi is relatively easy, too, which makes using one very practical.\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\n## What you need\r\n1. A Raspberry Pi (Duh)\r\nYou can find raspberry pis online for around 35 to 40 dollars. It doesn't particularly matter which raspberry pi you get, as long as it feeds your needs. One of the most common pis to get is the [Model B](http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/83-14421?scode=GS401&utm_medium=cse&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=google&catargetid=530004080000291138&cadevice=c&gclid=CNi6z4balsQCFY2TfgodkDIAWQ): \r\n![Raspberry Pi Model B](/RaspberryPiImages/RaspberryPiModelB.jpg)\r\n\r\n2. A [Power Source](https://www.virtuabotix.com/product/official-raspberry-pi-psu-usb-micro-ac-adapter-100-240vac-5060hz-input-1a-5v-output/?gclid=CN2CmurslsQCFU6VfgodER4A0w). You will need an AC adapter with a USB micro cable. Make sure the AC Adapter can power 5V.\r\n\r\n2. An [SD Card](http://www.walmart.com/ip/14271727?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227000427610&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40333325192&wl4=&wl5=pla&wl6=78294467072&veh=sem) with at least 4 GB (recommended 8GB) of memory. I recommend a micro SD card so you can use it with both a B and B+ Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\n3. A computer monitor or TV (with HDMI).\r\n\r\n4. A usb keyboard and mouse. I suggest a [keyboard](http://www.walmart.com/ip/17253322?wmlspartner=wlpa&adid=22222222227000987195&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40880346152&wl4=&wl5=pla&wl6=78810085952&veh=sem) that has the mouse track pad built into it so that you're only taking up one usb port on your raspberry pi.\r\n![Wireless keyboard](/RaspberryPiImages/LogitechWirelessKeyboard.jpg)\r\n\r\n5. HDMI Cable. You can get an [HDMI to HDMI](http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/A-V-Cables/12936/subcat.html?gclid=CLK_ncHblsQCFQGTfgodXBYATg&featuredproduct=4571618&featuredoption=11743182&cid=202290&kid=9553000357392&track=pspla&ci_src=17588969&ci_sku=12508359-000-002&ef_id=VPDlAAAABHSdegbU:20150307165908:s) cable or an [HDMI to DVI](http://www.computercablestore.com/2_Meter_656_FT_HDMI_to_DV_PID50414.aspx) cable, whichever fits your needs.\r\n\r\n6. A Network connection. You can either use a [Wifi Dongle](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?seq=1&kpid=8072&format=2&p_id=8072&CAWELAID=1329456150&CAGPSPN=pla%26catargetid=320013720000066114%26cadevice=c&gclid=CPfP5JLglsQCFUiEfgodaG4Auw), or an Ethernet cable connected to a wireless bridge. A network connection is important to have in case you want to install software on the pi or if you want to access your pi remotely.\r\n\r\n7. Speakers are optional.\r\n\r\n## Flashing the SD card with an image.\r\n\r\n>> Note: If you don't want to go through the process of flashing your own SD card, you can purchase a [pre-loaded one](http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=noobs+8gb+sd+card&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=30016330887&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13008567602860380120&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_7n6ojb957x_b) off Amazon or other websites.\r\n\r\nThe Raspberry Pi typically runs on a form of Debian (a linux-like operating system). The first step of getting your Raspberry Pi to run is to put this image on the SD card so that your Pi can actually boot up. While your Mac, or PC, uses a magnetic hard disc drive (HDD) or a Solid State Drive (SSD), your Raspberry Pi has no internal storage of its own.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Raspberry Pi uses a Secure Digital (SD) card, like the ones that are used for storage in digital cameras.\r\n\r\nThis means that the Raspberry Pi will run from whatever operating system you install on an SD card. You can easily flash the SD card with an operating system on your Mac or PC. Here's how:\r\n\r\n## Using OS X\r\n### Format the card\r\n\r\nFormatting an SD card is quite straight forward with Mac OS X. Start by pressing CMD SPACE to reveal the Spotlight search bar. In this search bar, type \"disk utility\" and press return to launch the Disk Utility application.\r\n\r\nSelect the SD card, in the left hand pane, and then select Erase ensuring that the format is \"MS-DOS (FAT)\". If the format is already MS-DOS (FAT), then you have nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\n### Identify the card\r\n\r\nOpen Terminal. If you need help finding this, press CMD SPACE as you did above and type in \"Terminal\" and press return. Type in `diskutil list` to get a list of the disks your computer is currently using. You should see this in your terminal:\r\n![diskutil list](/RaspberryPiImages/diskutilList.jpg)\r\n\r\nMake sure you know which disk is your SD card. For example, mine is `/dev/disk1`. If you use the wrong disk, you'll end up messing up your computer pretty badly.\r\n\r\nNext, you'll need to unmount your disk if it is automatically mounted. To do this, type in the terminal `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1`. Be sure to change the disk number if you identified yours to be different.\r\n\r\n### Downloading an image\r\n\r\nNow you'll want to download the image you want to put on your Pi. http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/ has many images to choose from. I personally chose the basic Raspbian image located at the top of this page: http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2015-02-17/. You may, however, choose whichever image fits you best.\r\n\r\n### Flash the card\r\n\r\nNow that you have an image downloaded, you'll want to navigate to the folder where you downloaded and extracted the image. This will typically be your Downloads folder if you did not change the location or extract the folder in a different place. If you haven't extracted your image yet, then simply open up Finder, navigate to your downloads folder and open the zip file you just downloaded.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the folder by typing `cd Downloads` into your terminal.\r\n\r\nNow we are going to use the dd command in terminal. This command is very powerful and you risk serious corruption to your Mac if you use it incorrectly. Triple check your command before executing it.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that you replace the .img and destination, in my example, with the correct .img name destination disc for yours, enter the following command:\r\n\r\n`sudo dd if=2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/disk1 bs=2m`\r\n\r\nThis process can take a few minutes, so go ahead and take a break. Go to the bathroom or get a snack. Once the process is complete, you should see a few lines in the terminal indicating records were transferred and bytes were moved. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n925+0 records in\r\n925+0 records out\r\n19398665600 bytes transferred in 576.382578 secs (3365587 bytes/sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou are now free to unmount the SD card for use on your Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n## Using Linux\r\n\r\nThe process is very similar to the OS X process, although there is a minor difference when identifying the card. When you want to identify the card, simply type `sudo fdisk -l`. The rest of the process is the same.\r\n\r\n## Using Windows\r\n### Format the card\r\n\r\nLocate your SD card drive, in Windows Explorer, and right-click the mouse to bring up the context-senstive menu. From the menu select **Format**…. Ensure that the option **FAT32 (Default)** is selected and click **Start**.\r\n\r\n![Selecting an SD card to format](/RaspberryPiImages/SelectingSDCardWindows.jpg)\r\n\r\nA few moments later you will see a confirmation that the format has been completed and you SD card is now ready for the next stage.\r\n\r\n![Formatting the SD Card](/RaspberryPiImages/FormattingSDCard.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Download Image Writer\r\n\r\nIn order to flash the SD card in Windows, it is necessary to first download a third-party application named [Image Writer](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer). (Here’s the [direct SourceForge link for Image Writer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download))\r\n\r\nOnce downloaded, uncompress the .zip file by secondary-clicking it and selecting Extract all from the context-sensitive menu. This will normally place a folder of extracted files into the same folder that contains the downloaded .zip file.\r\n\r\n### Flash the SD Card\r\n\r\nLocate and open the folder of uncompressed files that you recently downloaded. Launch the Image Writer application by double-clicking the **Win32DiskImager.exe** program that you can see in the folder of extracted files.\r\n\r\nIf your PC asks you, give permission for the program to make modifications. This will open the Image Writer program.\r\n\r\n![Grant permission for the program to run](/RaspberryPiImages/WindowsAppPermission.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn Image Writer click on the blue folder icon, to the right of the white box, and locate your .img file. This will be contained within a folder that you extracted from the downloaded .zip file. Select the .img file and click Open to populate the white box with the path to your image.\r\n\r\n![Selecting the Image in Image Writer](/RaspberryPiImages/ImageWriter.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the **Device** box, on the right, ensure that the drive letter for your SD card is selected.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** You can double-check the correct drive letter, for your SD card, by pressing CRTL E to open Windows Explorer and locating the SD card drive.\r\n\r\nWhen you are satisfied that the path to the .img file and the destination drive letter are both correct, click the **Write** button to start the process of flashing the SD card. The process will take four or five minutes and you will be shown a green progress bar during the course of the operation.\r\n\r\n![Image Writer Progress](/RaspberryPiImages/ImageWriterProgress.jpg)\r\n\r\nUpon completion, a confirmation window will be displayed and you will be free to close Image Writer and eject the SD card before removing it.\r\n\r\n![Confirmation message on completion of flashing the SD card](/RaspberryPiImages/IWcompletion.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Using the Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\nNow that you've flashed your SD card, go ahead and put it into the slot on your Raspberry Pi. Then you'll want to connect the HDMI cable, Wifi dongle/Ethernet cable, and finally the power cable.\r\n\r\n## Booting up\r\n\r\nOnce you plug your Pi into a power source, you'll see the boot process on your screen. Once it's done booting up, the pi will ask for your username and password. By default, all Raspbian images have the default username `pi` and the default password `raspberry`. Now you can do whatever you want!!! I recommend googling Raspberry Pi Projects and doing something cool. Remember, the more familiar you get with the raspberry pi, the more you will have to use bash (the command line). Don't be afraid to ask others if you have questions on how to do something in bash.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
