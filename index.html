<p>The Raspberry Pi typically runs on a form of Debian (a linux-like operating system). The first step of getting your Raspberry Pi to run is to put this image on the SD card so that your Pi can actually boot up. While your Mac, or PC, uses a magnetic hard disc drive (HDD) or a Solid State Drive (SSD), your Raspberry Pi has no internal storage of its own.</p>

<p>Instead, the Raspberry Pi uses a Secure Digital (SD) card, like the ones that are used for storage in digital cameras.</p>

<p>This means that the Raspberry Pi will run from whatever operating system you install on an SD card. You can easily flash the SD card with an operating system on your Mac or PC. Here's how:</p>

<h2>
<a id="using-os-x" class="anchor" href="#using-os-x" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using OS X</h2>

<h3>
<a id="format-the-card" class="anchor" href="#format-the-card" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Format the card</h3>

<p>Formatting an SD card is quite straight forward with Mac OS X. Start by pressing CMD SPACE to reveal the Spotlight search bar. In this search bar, type "disk utility" and press return to launch the Disk Utility application.</p>

<p>Select the SD card, in the left hand pane, and then select Erase ensuring that the format is "MS-DOS (FAT)". If the format is already MS-DOS (FAT), then you have nothing to worry about.</p>

<h3>
<a id="identify-the-card" class="anchor" href="#identify-the-card" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Identify the card</h3>

<p>Open Terminal. If you need help finding this, press CMD SPACE as you did above and type in "Terminal" and press return. Type in <code>diskutil list</code> to get a list of the disks your computer is currently using. You should see this in your terminal:
<img src="/RaspberryPiImages/diskutilList.jpg" alt="diskutil list"></p>

<p>Make sure you know which disk is your SD card. For example, mine is <code>/dev/disk1</code>. If you use the wrong disk, you'll end up messing up your computer pretty badly.</p>

<p>Next, you'll need to unmount your disk if it is automatically mounted. To do this, type in the terminal <code>diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1</code>. Be sure to change the disk number if you identified yours to be different.</p>

<h3>
<a id="downloading-an-image" class="anchor" href="#downloading-an-image" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Downloading an image</h3>

<p>Now you'll want to download the image you want to put on your Pi. <a href="http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/">http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/</a> has many images to choose from. I personally chose the basic Raspbian image located at the top of this page: <a href="http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2015-02-17/">http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2015-02-17/</a>. You may, however, choose whichever image fits you best.</p>

<h3>
<a id="flash-the-card" class="anchor" href="#flash-the-card" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flash the card</h3>

<p>Now that you have an image downloaded, you'll want to navigate to the folder where you downloaded and extracted the image. This will typically be your Downloads folder if you did not change the location or extract the folder in a different place. If you haven't extracted your image yet, then simply open up Finder, navigate to your downloads folder and open the zip file you just downloaded.</p>

<p>Navigate to the folder by typing <code>cd Downloads</code> into your terminal.</p>

<p>Now we are going to use the dd command in terminal. This command is very powerful and you risk serious corruption to your Mac if you use it incorrectly. Triple check your command before executing it.</p>

<p>Ensuring that you replace the .img and destination, in my example, with the correct .img name destination disc for yours, enter the following command:</p>

<p><code>sudo dd if=2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/disk1 bs=2m</code></p>

<p>This process can take a few minutes, so go ahead and take a break. Go to the bathroom or get a snack. Once the process is complete, you should see a few lines in the terminal indicating records were transferred and bytes were moved. For example:</p>

<pre><code>925+0 records in
925+0 records out
19398665600 bytes transferred in 576.382578 secs (3365587 bytes/sec)
</code></pre>

<p>You are now free to unmount the SD card for use on your Raspberry Pi</p>

<h2>
<a id="using-linux" class="anchor" href="#using-linux" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Linux</h2>

<p>The process is very similar to the OS X process, although there is a minor difference when identifying the card. When you want to identify the card, simply type <code>sudo fdisk -l</code>. The rest of the process is the same.</p>

<h2>
<a id="using-windows" class="anchor" href="#using-windows" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Windows</h2>

<h3>
<a id="format-the-card-1" class="anchor" href="#format-the-card-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Format the card</h3>

<p>Locate your SD card drive, in Windows Explorer, and right-click the mouse to bring up the context-senstive menu. From the menu select <strong>Format</strong>…. Ensure that the option <strong>FAT32 (Default)</strong> is selected and click <strong>Start</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/RaspberryPiImages/SelectingSDCardWindows.jpg" alt="Selecting an SD card to format"></p>

<p>A few moments later you will see a confirmation that the format has been completed and you SD card is now ready for the next stage.</p>

<p><img src="/RaspberryPiImages/FormattingSDCard.jpg" alt="Formatting the SD Card"></p>

<h3>
<a id="download-image-writer" class="anchor" href="#download-image-writer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download Image Writer</h3>

<p>In order to flash the SD card in Windows, it is necessary to first download a third-party application named <a href="https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer">Image Writer</a>. (Here’s the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download">direct SourceForge link for Image Writer</a>)</p>

<p>Once downloaded, uncompress the .zip file by secondary-clicking it and selecting Extract all from the context-sensitive menu. This will normally place a folder of extracted files into the same folder that contains the downloaded .zip file.</p>

<h3>
<a id="flash-the-sd-card" class="anchor" href="#flash-the-sd-card" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flash the SD Card</h3>

<p>Locate and open the folder of uncompressed files that you recently downloaded. Launch the Image Writer application by double-clicking the <strong>Win32DiskImager.exe</strong> program that you can see in the folder of extracted files.</p>

<p>If your PC asks you, give permission for the program to make modifications. This will open the Image Writer program.</p>

<p><img src="/RaspberryPiImages/WindowsAppPermission.jpg" alt="Grant permission for the program to run"></p>

<p>In Image Writer click on the blue folder icon, to the right of the white box, and locate your .img file. This will be contained within a folder that you extracted from the downloaded .zip file. Select the .img file and click Open to populate the white box with the path to your image.</p>

<p><img src="/RaspberryPiImages/ImageWriter.jpg" alt="Selecting the Image in Image Writer"></p>

<p>In the <strong>Device</strong> box, on the right, ensure that the drive letter for your SD card is selected.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can double-check the correct drive letter, for your SD card, by pressing CRTL E to open Windows Explorer and locating the SD card drive.</p>

<p>When you are satisfied that the path to the .img file and the destination drive letter are both correct, click the <strong>Write</strong> button to start the process of flashing the SD card. The process will take four or five minutes and you will be shown a green progress bar during the course of the operation.</p>

<p><img src="/RaspberryPiImages/ImageWriterProgress.jpg" alt="Image Writer Progress"></p>

<p>Upon completion, a confirmation window will be displayed and you will be free to close Image Writer and eject the SD card before removing it.</p>

<p>Now that you've flashed your SD card, go ahead and put it into the slot on your Raspberry Pi. Then you'll want to connect the HDMI cable, Wifi dongle/Ethernet cable, and finally the power cable.</p>

<h2>
<a id="booting-up" class="anchor" href="#booting-up" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Booting up</h2>

<p>Once you plug your Pi into a power source, you'll see the boot process on your screen. Once it's done booting up, the pi will ask for your username and password. By default, all Raspbian images have the default username <code>pi</code> and the default password <code>raspberry</code>. Now you can do whatever you want!!! I recommend googling Raspberry Pi Projects and doing something cool. Remember, the more familiar you get with the raspberry pi, the more you will have to use bash (the command line). Don't be afraid to ask others if you have questions on how to do something in bash.</p>
